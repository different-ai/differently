[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased] — on `pre-release`

### Added

- Control plane (`differently-server`):
  - v1 API, API keys with scopes, organizations and projects;
  - atomic quota admission and activation, fair queueing;
  - policy-driven placement with fail-closed external providers;
  - scheduler and reconciler;
  - tamper-evident audit chain, trust report, usage estimates;
  - Prometheus metrics, built-in dashboard;
  - memory and Postgres stores.
- Adapters:
  - `opensandbox`, the default private runtime: OpenSandbox servers as
    pools with operator-declared trust and isolation, covering create, exec
    and streamed exec, files, pause/resume, snapshots, fork and port
    endpoints;
  - Daytona, Freestyle;
  - `remote` (plugin protocol);
  - `devhost` (dev only).
- CLI (`differently`), Go, TypeScript and Python SDKs, OpenAPI 3.1 spec.
- Helm chart for the control plane, with an `opensandbox` block that
  registers an existing OpenSandbox server as the default pool; AWS
  Terraform module.
- End-to-end suite (`make e2e`): Postgres, the server and an OpenSandbox
  server in Docker, driven through the public API.
- Documentation: architecture RFC, ADRs, security model, adapter spec,
  placement policy, feature parity, deployment guides, roadmap and backlog.

### Changed

- OpenSandbox replaces Differently's own Firecracker node agent as the
  private runtime ([ADR 0020](docs/adr/0020-opensandbox-replaces-node-agent.md)).
  The following were removed before any release:
  - `differently-agent`, `differently-guest` and the `firecracker` adapter;
  - agent registration, heartbeats and per-agent secrets;
  - the guest image scripts and systemd units.

  The server's config parser and the Helm schema reject the removed
  settings (`auth.agentTokenEnv`, `scheduler.agentTimeoutSeconds`,
  `agent.*`). Postgres migration `0002` drops the `agents` table.
- The trust report shows each pool's declared isolation and states that
  isolation and egress come from the backend runtime, not from Differently.

### Security

- `audit.failClosed` refuses state-changing requests that cannot be audited;
  `differently_audit_append_failures_total` counts audit failures.
- `metrics.listen` serves `/metrics` on its own port; the Helm chart does this
  by default (port 9091), keeping metrics off the ingress.

### Fixed (found by the end-to-end suite)

- `start` refused every request after the first one: the lifecycle handler
  reused state between requests.
- The reconciler could correct a sandbox in the middle of a change. It now
  waits 30 seconds after any change, and follows the backend's state: a
  sandbox that stopped behind the control plane's back is reported `stopped`.
- `differently sandbox list -o json` printed an object instead of an array
  for a single sandbox.

### Verified

- End-to-end suite against OpenSandbox 1.2.0 (Docker runtime) on arm64
  Colima: 10/10, twice. Not yet verified:
  - OpenSandbox's Kubernetes and Fast Sandbox runtimes;
  - x86_64 hosts and real clusters;
  - live Daytona and Freestyle accounts.
